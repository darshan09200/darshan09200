### 👋 Welcome, GitHub Adventurer!
I'm **Darshan Jain**, a mobile software engineer with a focus on building high-performance, scalable applications using React Native, TypeScript, and modern developer tooling.

I thrive at the intersection of product and platform — designing architecture that scales, refining workflows that enable teams, and sweating the details that shape great mobile experiences.

Currently, I lead mobile development at [Vetster](https://vetster.com), a virtual care platform for pets, where I’ve contributed significantly to performance optimization, architecture, and developer experience as the product and team scale.

#### ⚙️ [eslint-plugin-lodash-specific-import](https://github.com/darshan09200/eslint-plugin-lodash-specific-import)

An ESLint plugin I brewed to enforce clean `lodash` import practices — because every byte counts in the land of mobile.  
It’s helped reduce bundle bloat and streamline contributor onboarding.
